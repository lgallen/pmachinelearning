================

This repo contains the final project for Practical Machine Learning, Course 8 in the Johns Hopkins Data Specialization on Coursera. The goal of the project was to build a predictive model to grade experiment participants on how well they performed exercises based on accelerometers they were wearing. 

You can find a gh-pages hosted version of the [final report here] (http://lgallen.github.io/pmachinelearninghtml/) for easier viewing.
